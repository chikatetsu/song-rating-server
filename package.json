  "description": "This is the server part of the Song Rating environment. It's an API developped in Python using FastAPI and Uvicorn. The server is a centralized way to store the leaderboard since you can run a Song Rating client on different devices. The API exposes routes to get the leaderboard, vote for a song, get info on the current rate of a song or artist, and see if a song  has already been compared to an other. See `/docs` for all endpoints.",
